# Idea:
To build an disaster management android application for the users.

**Goal of the application is to be a one stop point for multiple entities to get/provide help. In a nutshell, connecting users to different teams(rescue, food distribution, medic, etc)**

The users would have an android app which would be connected to the internet(could also be provided as a service on top of a most commonly used android application)

**Features:**
```
1. Get emergency help(SOS), share the details of the requirement of resources(along with the associated people names/count) if any(medical,clothing, food,etc)
- All the requirement data is aggregated to get the estimate of the resource requirements for a specfic location

2. Register as volunteer to help/donate resources
- People can join the volunteer teams to help the people stuck in the calamity
- People can wish to donate resources(teams will be sent to pick them up)

3. Send instruction updates during the calamity to keep users safe
- Sending push updates to users like ("food is on way, collect point xyz time: 8:20pm", "mild tornado expected around 5:30pm-5:40pm" and other similar messages from the govt/teams if any)

4. Set up a chatbot to answer common user queries
- Answering queries about helpline numbers, or to answering questions like "stuck, don't know what to do"

5. Share geographical location(GPS) feature so that we can know the location of the users and respond to requests
- Users can share their location so that we can make resource allocation estimates at a geographic level

6. Mark safe feature to mark themselves and their friends/family as safe
- Mark safe feature similar to facebook

7. A search feature for a user to query about friends/family member status
```
# Future Scope:
```
1. Region based analytics:
- Prediction of major/minor calamities to occur
- Using social network data(ex: get additional data about the affected regions from trending tweets)

2. Intergrating into small scale gadgets like watches, bands, backpacks for a range of users including children
- Get frequent updates of location(Ex: if the location is changing, the person is active, else there might be an issue, etc)
```
